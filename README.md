<h1>Objectives:</h1>

<ul>Use what we've learned about <b>CSS</b> to recreate the following website</ul>

<p>This is a tricky assignment, let's make sure we build in layers working from the top down and from the outside to the inside.<br>

This assignment may take us upwards of 4 hours to complete, this is normal as <b>CSS</b> can be time consuming. <b>We strongly suggest working in groups</b>, pair programming is a common programming practice.</p>
